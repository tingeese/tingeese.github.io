<h1>About Us</h1>



<h2 id="robert-chambers-founder-ceo">Robert Chambers - <small>Founder &amp; CEO</small></h2>

<img class="hero" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tingeese.dev&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;robertc.1038b362c830ba43.png" alt="The author on the coast of the Mediterranean in Marseille, France" />
<p>Robert studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the 
<a href="https://www.ups.edu">University of Puget Sound</a> before enlisting in the US Navy in 2003.  Trained as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_ratings#Aviation_ratings">aviation electronics technician</a>,
he reported to the &quot;World Famous BattleCats&quot; of 
<a href="https://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/chsmwp/hsm73/Pages/Welcome.aspx">HSL-43</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#hsm73">1</a></sup> in San Diego, CA where he qualified 
as a Plane Captain, Avionics Troubleshooter, and Collateral Duty Inspector<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#cdi">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Promoted twice in his first two years, Robert was subsequently selected to the prestigious
<a href="https://www.netc.navy.mil/Commands/Naval-Service-Training-Command/STA-21/">Seaman-to-Admiral 21</a> officer accession
program. Although a medical issue prevented his completion of the program, Robert is proud to have been honorably
discharged in 2007 having achieved the rate of AT2(AW)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rate">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>After earning his private pilot certificate and spending two years as a Manufacturing Manager on Boeing's 747-8 program, 
Robert then landed at <a href="https://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/horizon-air-history">Horizon Air</a>,
Alaska Airlines' regional subsidiary.  It was at Horizon that Robert — dissatisfied with Horizon's ground
employee scheduling solution — wrote his first production software.</p>
<p>This tool, dubbed IRSDA<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#irsda">4</a></sup>, leveraged the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a>
to provide a web portal where employees and supervisors could both engage in the robust shift bidding &amp; trading
economies popular at most airlines, and assign and monitor job assignments in real-time. IRSDA automated most of the
decision-making driven by complex scheduling policies and improved the productivity of front-line employees, supervisors
and administrative staff while almost eliminating cost-driving errors.</p>

        alt="The best looking tail on the flightline: Horizon&#x27;s meatball"
        
        height="100" 
/>
<p>Robert deployed his software at Horizon's two biggest hubs (<a href="https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac">SEA</a> &amp;
<a href="https://www.flypdx.com/">PDX</a>) and supported its operation for over 5 years without a single operational disruption and a 
total of only 18 minutes unscheduled downtime.</p>
<p>Robert's success with IRSDA led to his promotion as a Project Manager within Horizon's Strategy &amp; Analytics division where he was
empowered to build more tools to enhance Horizon's already nation-leading operational excellence.  In addition
to coding, Robert worked on the operational analytics team and routinely advised the most senior leaders of the company.</p>
<p>With the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert &amp; his family decided to chart a new course, and he left 
Alaska Air Group to found Tin Geese LLC. In this new role, Robert continues to provide strategic advice and data-driven 
insights to leaders in the airline industry as well as seeking out and solving other problems that seem worthwhile. Robert
is also pleased participate in the open source community.</p>
