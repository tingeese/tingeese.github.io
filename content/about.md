## Robert Chambers - <small>Founder & CEO</small>

{{ hero(path="images/robertc.png", alt="The author on the coast of the Mediterranean in Marseille, France") }}

Robert studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the 
[University of Puget Sound](https://www.ups.edu) before enlisting in the US Navy in 2003.  Trained as an
[aviation electronics technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_ratings#Aviation_ratings),
he reported to the "World Famous BattleCats" of 
[HSL-43](https://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/chsmwp/hsm73/Pages/Welcome.aspx)[^hsm73] in San Diego, CA where he qualified 
as a Plane Captain, Avionics Troubleshooter, and Collateral Duty Inspector[^cdi].

Promoted twice in his first two years, Robert was subsequently selected to the prestigious
[Seaman-to-Admiral 21](https://www.netc.navy.mil/Commands/Naval-Service-Training-Command/STA-21/) officer accession
program. Although a medical issue prevented his completion of the program, Robert is proud to have been honorably
discharged in 2007 having achieved the rate of AT2(AW)[^rate].

After earning his private pilot certificate and spending two years as a Manufacturing Manager on Boeing's 747-8 program, 
Robert then landed at [Horizon Air](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/horizon-air-history),
Alaska Airlines' regional subsidiary.  It was at Horizon that Robert &mdash; dissatisfied with Horizon's ground
employee scheduling solution &mdash; wrote his first production software.

This tool, dubbed IRSDA[^irsda], leveraged the [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle))
to provide a web portal where employees and supervisors could both engage in the robust shift bidding & trading
economies popular at most airlines, and assign and monitor job assignments in real-time. IRSDA automated most of the
decision-making driven by complex scheduling policies and improved the productivity of front-line employees, supervisors
and administrative staff while almost eliminating cost-driving errors.

Robert deployed his software at Horizon's two biggest hubs ([SEA](https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac) &
[PDX](https://www.flypdx.com/)) and supported its operation for over 5 years without a single operational disruption and a 
total of only 18 minutes unscheduled downtime.

Robert's success with IRSDA led to his promotion as a Project Manager within Horizon's Strategy & Analytics division where he was
empowered to build more tools to enhance Horizon's already nation-leading operational excellence.  In addition
to coding, Robert worked on the operational analytics team and routinely advised the most senior leaders of the company.

With the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert & his family decided to chart a new course, and he left 
Alaska Air Group to found Tin Geese LLC. In this new role, Robert continues to provide strategic advice and data-driven 
insights to leaders in the airline industry as well as seeking out and solving other problems that seem worthwhile. Robert
is also pleased participate in the open source community.
